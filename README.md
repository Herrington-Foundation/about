# Herrington Foundation
This fork is a answer for [new terminology](https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-team-approves-new-terminology-bans-terms-like-blacklist-and-slave/) accepted by Linus Torvalds, reducting inclusive language on IT to absurdity. This fork reverts these changes and *uses* such terms as "master" and "slave" because it also used in Gachimuchi community.

## What is Gachimuchi
"Gachimuchi" (ガチムチ = ガチガチ (muscular) + ムチムチ (plump)) implies to attractive, wrestler-like plump and muscular body type. Also it's mostly an internet meme that involves Billy Herrington and other gay porn actors, whose the footage was edited/remixed in many different ways, including phonetic translation, sampling the sound of butt spanking, as well as music remixes featuring 3D model characters and fanart of the actors.

## How name is decided
Original thread on 4chan was been removed, there's google-translated thread on 2ch imageboard instead (answers translated from Russian).

Sup /g/. BLM, SJW and LGBTQ+ insult me because they replace words like *slave* and *master* in the Linux kernel. I think /g/ in LGBTQ+ is GachiMuchi and Gentoo, and only after gay. In our Gachimuchi culture, the first child words is "Dungeon Master", the second is "Fucking Slave." The whole philosophy is built on the relationship between Master and Slave. But when they say that Master and Slave is racism, I think it is very, very insulting to me and other slaves of our religion. But what does Linux have to do with it? Because I am also a Gentoo user and I love cumpile @world and core. Cumpilation is also the core of our GachiMuchi community. I think we need to stop the fucking slaves homophobia from SJW and BLM. And I think we need a kernel fork. Words like Slave will be replaced with FuckingSlave, Master with DungeonMaster, other words like compile will be replaced with cumplile. And this way we can correct all the injustices in @world.
We cannot choose a name for the new fork. ITT roll the name.
